# BlogsAPI

The point of this api is to ingest blog posts which are made up of a title & a collection of this paragraphs and store them in a database. Prior to storing these posts, the paragraphs must be split into sentences and checked to ensure that none of the word's within those sentences are "foul" words. Depending on the result of that check, a database property on the row for that blog post should either be marked True or False.
